<p>so_long is a 2D mini-game coded in C using an imposed lib: minilibx (mlx), as part of my schooling at 42. The goal of this game is to collect all the fairies in the game in one minimum movements.<br>
To achieve this, I had to manage the analysis of a map with the .ber extension, the character's movements (use W, A, S and D to move), and closing the window with escape or by clicking on the cross.</p>

<h2 id="-bonus-part">‚≠ê Bonus Part</h2>
<p>For this project, we are encouraged to create our own bonuses, but there are only three that grant extra points: enemy handling, animated sprites, and displaying the player's move count directly on the window.<br>
In addition to these three bonuses, I personally decided to add a counter of collected fairies as well as an end image depending on success or failure.</p>
